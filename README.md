A pure SVG version of the Nyan Cat animation (w/o audio). My toy project for learning SVG.

## Credits
**All frames of the cat running animation** just come from [@iliana](https://github.com/iliana)'s "HTML5 Nyan Cat":
- https://github.com/iliana/html5nyancat

It also uses the following projects as references:
- https://github.com/michalbe/css-nyan-cat
- https://github.com/cristurm/nyan-cat

Certainly also heavily relys on:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4 (the original one)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkgTxQm9DWM (HD remake)
