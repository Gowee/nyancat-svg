## Credits
**All frames of the cat running animation** just come from [@iliana](https://github.com/iliana)'s "HTML5 Nyan Cat":
- https://github.com/iliana/html5nyancat

It also uses the following projects as references:
- https://github.com/michalbe/css-nyan-cat
- https://github.com/cristurm/nyan-cat

Certainly also heavily relys on:
